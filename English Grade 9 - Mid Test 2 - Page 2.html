                            <p>The sentence describes the streets filled with many people during New Year's Eve. "Packed" is the most appropriate word here, as it specifically describes a large number of people crowded in a space.

                                <li>"full" - can describe a crowded place but is less vivid and specific than "packed"</li>
                                <li>"packed" - best describes a place extremely crowded with people</li>
                                <li>"stuck" - implies inability to move but doesn't necessarily indicate a crowd</li>
                                <li>"tight" - can describe cramped spaces but is less common for describing streets with crowds</li>

                            "The streets were packed with people" is a common collocation to describe crowded streets.

                            <p>The word "As" is the correct choice because it introduces a clause describing something happening simultaneously with another action. The narrator is thinking about the future while watching the fireworks.

                                <li>"As" - correctly indicates "while" or "at the same time as" - the person was thinking while watching</li>
                                <li>"So" - would indicate a result or consequence, which doesn't fit here</li>
                                <li>"During" - would need to be followed by a noun, not a clause with subject and verb</li>
                                <li>"Before" - would indicate the thinking happened prior to watching the fireworks, which contradicts the meaning</li>

                            "As we were watching" correctly shows the simultaneous nature of the two actions.

                        <p>From the root word "IMPORTANT" (adjective), we need to form a noun to complete the sentence. The correct noun form is "importance" which means "the quality of being important." The phrase "the importance of balanced nutrition" is grammatically correct and makes sense in this educational context.</p>

                        <p><strong>Correct answer: Naturally</strong></p>
                        <p>From the root word "NATURE" (noun), we need to form an adverb that can start a sentence. The correct form is "Naturally," which is used to indicate something happens in a normal or expected way. In this context, it means "as would be expected" or "of course." The sentence structure suggests we need an adverb at the beginning to modify the entire statement.</p>

                        <p>From the root word "NOURISH" (verb), we need to form an adjective to describe "meals." The correct adjective form is "nourishing" which means "providing nutrients needed for growth and good health." The present participle form of the verb "nourish" functions as an adjective in this sentence to describe what kind of meals are essential.</p>

                        <p>From the root word "EAT" (verb), we need to form a noun that can describe "habits." The gerund form "eating" works as a noun in this context. "Eating habits" is a common collocation that refers to the way a person typically consumes food - what, when, and how they eat. The sentence structure requires a noun that can function as an adjective before "habits."</p>

                        <p>From the root word "BALANCE" (noun or verb), we need to form an adjective to describe "diet." The correct form is "balanced" (the past participle of the verb "to balance" used as an adjective). A "balanced diet" is one that contains the proper proportions of food categories needed for good health. The sentence structure requires an adjective before the noun "diet."</p>

                        <p>The root word "ENHANCE" is already a verb, and we need a verb form after "to" in this sentence. The base form "enhance" (meaning "to improve or add to the quality or value of something") is the correct form following the infinitive marker "to." In this structure, we need the base form of the verb without any changes.</p>

                        <p>Based on the dictionary entry, "equal number" is one of the standard phrases using "equal." This phrase is used to indicate that two groups have the same quantity.

                        <p><strong>Correct answer: Despite being old, the woman still exercises every day.</strong></p>
                        <p>To rewrite this sentence starting with "Despite," we need to change the clause structure:
                        <ul class="list-disc ml-6">
                            <li>Original: "Although the woman is old, she still exercises every day."</li>

                        </ul>
                        The conjunction "Although" introduces a subordinate clause with a subject and verb ("the woman is old"). When we replace it with "Despite," we need to use a gerund construction ("being old") because "despite" is a preposition that must be followed by a noun or noun phrase, not a clause.</p>

                        <p><strong>Correct answer: The doctor advised Tommy to drink plenty of water every day.</strong></p>
                        <p>To rewrite this sentence using "advised" instead of "suggested," we need to change the clause structure:
                        <ul class="list-disc ml-6">
                            <li>Original: "The doctor suggested that Tommy should drink plenty of water every day."</li>

                        </ul>
                        The verb "suggest" can be followed by a that-clause with "should," but the verb "advise" is typically followed by an object (Tommy) and an infinitive with "to" (to drink). Both verbs have different grammatical patterns despite having similar meanings.</p>

                        <p>To rewrite this sentence starting with "Although," we need to change the preposition phrase to a clause:
                        <ul class="list-disc ml-6">
                            <li>Original: "In spite of being on a diet, Kate ate a big slice of chocolate cake at the party."</li>
                            <li>Rewritten: "Although Kate was on a diet, she ate a big slice of chocolate cake at the party."</li>
                        </ul>
                        "In spite of" is a complex preposition followed by a gerund phrase ("being on a diet"). When we replace it with "Although," we need to form a full subordinate clause with a subject and verb ("Kate was on a diet"). Note that we also need to repeat the subject "she" in the main clause.</p>

                        <p>To rewrite this sentence using "suggested," we need to change the direct speech to reported speech:
                        <ul class="list-disc ml-6">
                            <li>Original: ""Why don't we grab some lunch at the cafeteria today?" Alex told us."</li>

                        </ul>
                        This transformation requires several changes:
                        <ol class="list-decimal ml-6">
                            <li>Change "Why don't we" (which is a suggestion) to "suggested (that) we (should)"</li>

                            <li>Change the subject-verb order (from "Alex told us" to "Alex suggested")</li>
                            <li>Remove the question marks and quotation marks</li>
                        </ol>
                        Note: Both "suggested that we grab" and "suggested that we should grab" are grammatically correct.</p>
