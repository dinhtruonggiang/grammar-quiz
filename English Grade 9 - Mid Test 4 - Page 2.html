                        <p>The sentence expresses a hope about the future, so we need a future tense. "Will be" is the correct form to express a future state. "Going to" would be incomplete without "be", "would be" is used for hypothetical situations, and "going to be" would work grammatically but is not the best option because "will be" is more commonly used with hopes about the future.</p>

                        <p>The correct collocation with "pictures" is "take pictures." We "take" photos or pictures with a camera. "Make pictures" would refer to creating drawings or artwork, "see pictures" means to view them, and "get pictures" could mean receiving them from someone else.</p>

                        <p>"Since" is used to indicate the starting point of an action that continues to the present. The writer started playing instruments at age six and continues to play them. "For" is used with periods of time (e.g., "for ten years"), not with a specific point in time. "After" would mean they only started playing after age six, and "before" would incorrectly suggest they played before they were six.</p>

                        <p>The word "SCENERY" needs to be changed to its adjectival form "scenic" to describe the boat ride. We need an adjective before the noun "boat ride." "Scenery" is a noun that refers to the view or landscape itself, while "scenic" describes something related to beautiful scenery.</p>

                        <p>The word "EASE" needs to be changed to its adverbial form "easily" to describe how Phuket can be accessed. We need an adverb to modify the adjective "accessible." "Ease" is a noun, while "easily" is the adverb form used to describe how something is done.</p>

                        <p>The word "TRAVEL" needs to be changed to "Travelers" as we need a noun that refers to people who travel. The sentence requires a subject at the beginning, and "Travelers" fits as the people who would go to An Bang beach.</p>

                        <p>The word "INTEREST" needs to be changed to its adjectival form "interesting" to describe "thing." We need an adjective that describes what quality the thing has. "Interest" is a noun, while "interesting" is the adjective that describes something that causes interest.</p>

                        <p>The word "DECIDE" needs to be changed to its noun form "decision," as we need a noun after the indefinite article "a(n)." "Decide" is a verb, while "decision" is the noun form that refers to the choice or determination that is made.</p>

                        <p>The word "FRIEND" needs to be changed to its adjectival form "friendly" to describe the neighbors. We need an adjective after "very" to describe what kind of neighbors they are. "Friend" is a noun, while "friendly" is the adjective that describes someone who behaves in a kind way.</p>

                        <p><strong>Correct answer: easiest mountain to climb in the region</strong></p>
                        <p>To rewrite the comparative sentence "easier to climb than other mountains" into a superlative form, we change it to "the easiest mountain to climb in the region." This transforms the comparative structure to a superlative one while maintaining the same meaning.</p>

                        <p>To rewrite the sentence using "SPENT," we need to change the structure to "We spent [amount of time] [gerund]..." So "We spent about two hours reaching the summit of Mount Langbiang" or "We spent about two hours climbing to the summit of Mount Langbiang" would be correct answers.</p>

                        <p>When using "PREFERS" to show a comparison of preference between two activities, the structure is "prefer [something] to [something else]." So "My sister prefers exploring new cities to relaxing on the beach" correctly expresses the original meaning.</p>

                        <p>To rewrite the sentence using "AS," we need to transform "less famous than" to "not as famous as." The complete rewritten sentence would be "Đồng Văn Karst Plateau Geopark is not as famous as Hạ Long Bay although/despite it has breathtaking scenery."</p>
