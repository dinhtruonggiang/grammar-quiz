                            <p>The context shows a contrast between "all these websites talking about detox" and the scientist's assertion that "it's a myth" that you can eat certain things to detox. Let's analyze each option:
                            <ul class="list-disc ml-6">
                                <li>"despite" - followed by a noun phrase, not a clause; would require "despite all these websites..."</li>
                                <li>"in spite" - similar to "despite", requires "of" following it; not grammatical in this context</li>
                                <li>"although" - introduces a subordinate clause and shows contrast; can come at the beginning of a sentence</li>
                                <li>"though" - means the same as "although" but is more informal; could work, but "although" is more appropriate in formal writing</li>
                            </ul>
                            "Although" is the best choice because it properly introduces the contrasting clause "all these websites talking about detox" before the main point that "it's a myth".</p>

                            <p>The context discusses foods that are good for you and protect your organs. Let's analyze each option:
                            <ul class="list-disc ml-6">
                                <li>"calories" - refers to energy content of food; doesn't match with the examples of salad with olive oil or nuts as protective foods</li>
                                <li>"nutrients" - substances that provide nourishment essential for growth and health; matches with the examples given</li>
                                <li>"fats" - while some healthy fats exist in olive oil and nuts, the generic term "fats" doesn't encompass all beneficial elements in these foods</li>
                                <li>"vitamins" - specific type of nutrients; too narrow for the context that includes various beneficial compounds</li>
                            </ul>
                            "Nutrients" is the most appropriate term because it broadly covers all beneficial substances in foods like olive oil and nuts that help protect our organs.</p>

                            <p>The context discusses junk food and why it makes people feel terrible. The sentence structure indicates that this food is "not really [word]" followed by "although it gives you lots of calories." Let's analyze each option:
                            <ul class="list-disc ml-6">
                                <li>"natural" - refers to foods from nature, without processing; doesn't fit the contrast with calorie content</li>
                                <li>"harmful" - would make the "although" clause illogical; if it's harmful, high calories wouldn't be a contrasting positive</li>
                                <li>"nourishing" - means providing nutrients needed for growth and health; creates the logical contrast: not nourishing despite having calories</li>
                                <li>"dangerous" - too extreme, and again wouldn't make sense with the "although" clause</li>
                            </ul>
                            "Nourishing" is the best choice because it creates the appropriate contrast: junk food has calories (energy) but lacks the nutrients that make food truly nourishing for the body.</p>

                                <li>"promote" - means to support or encourage something; fits well with government actions to encourage healthy living</li>
                                <li>"maintain" - suggests keeping something at the same level; doesn't fit with initiating new policies</li>
                                <li>"protect" - while governments might protect citizens, the phrase "protect healthy living" is not a natural collocation</li>
                            </ul>
                            "Promote" is the best choice because it matches the action of governments taking steps to encourage and support healthy living habits, such as regulating advertising.</p>

                            <p>The context refers to the number of children who are obese worldwide. Let's analyze each option:
                            <ul class="list-disc ml-6">
                                <li>"much" - used with uncountable nouns; "children" is countable, so this is incorrect</li>
                                <li>"many" - used with countable nouns; grammatically correct with "children" but the phrase "so many" often implies comparison</li>
                                <li>"a lot of" - can be used with both countable and uncountable nouns; "so a lot of" isn't grammatically correct though</li>
                                <li>"a few" - indicates a small number, which contradicts the concerning tone about obesity levels</li>
                            </ul>
                            The most likely answer is B. "many" because it correctly modifies the countable noun "children" and works with "so" to form "so many" - a common expression indicating a large quantity that's concerning.</p>

                            <p>This transformation requires changing "despite" (which is followed by a noun or gerund) to "though" (which is followed by a clause):
                            <ul class="list-disc ml-6">
                                <li>"Despite feeling tired" must be transformed to a clause with "though"</li>
                                <li>We need to add a subject (she) and change the gerund (feeling) to a verb form (was/felt)</li>
                                <li>The rest of the sentence remains unchanged</li>
                            </ul>
                            The transformation maintains the contrasting relationship between Maria's tiredness and her decision to go jogging.</p>

                            <p>This transformation requires changing "I think you should" to "I suggest (that)":
                            <ul class="list-disc ml-6">
                                <li>"I think you should" is replaced with "I suggest (that)"</li>
                                <li>After "suggest" we can use "that" (which is optional in informal English)</li>
                                <li>The verb after "suggest that" remains in the base form without "should"</li>
                            </ul>
                            The transformation maintains the meaning of giving advice or a recommendation while using "suggest" instead of "think you should."</p>

                            <p>This transformation requires changing direct speech with a conditional to reported speech using "advised":
                            <ul class="list-disc ml-6">
                                <li>Direct speech: "If I were you, I would..." becomes "She advised me to..."</li>
                                <li>"Advise" is followed by an object (me) and an infinitive (to schedule)</li>
                                <li>The possessive "your" changes to "my" in reported speech to maintain the reference to the person receiving the advice</li>

                            The transformation correctly converts the conditional advice in direct speech to reported speech using "advised."</p>
