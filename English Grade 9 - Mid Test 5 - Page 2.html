                        <p>The correct answer is "where" because we need a relative adverb that refers to a place. The context suggests "large plastic bubbles" will be places in which people can live and breathe, so "where" is the appropriate word to introduce this information. "Where" is used to introduce a relative clause that specifies a location.</p>

                        <p>The word "like" is used to make a comparison. In this context, the sentence is saying we need to find another planet that has similar characteristics to Earth. "Like" is the most appropriate word to express this similarity.</p>

                        <p>The correct answer is "too" because the sentence is explaining that Mercury and Venus are excessively hot, making them uninhabitable for humans. "Too" indicates an excessive amount that causes a negative consequence (in this case, being unable to live there). The structure "too + adjective + for + someone" is commonly used to express that something exceeds acceptable limits.</p>

                        <p>The word "Unfortunately" is the most appropriate because the sentence introduces a negative situation or problem - the fact that even if we find a suitable planet, it would be very far away. "Unfortunately" is an adverb used to express regret or disappointment about a situation, which matches the tone of this sentence as it describes an obstacle to finding a habitable planet.</p>

                        <p>The verb "get" is the most appropriate in this context because it's a general verb of movement that can be used for reaching a destination by any means. Since we're talking about space travel to another planet, specific verbs like "drive" or "ride" are too limited and not suitable. "Come" would be more appropriate if the perspective was from someone already at the destination. "Get" is versatile and commonly used in the phrase "get there" to mean reaching a destination.</p>

                        <p>The correct form is "healthy" - an adjective formed from the noun "health." In this sentence, we need an adjective to describe the state of the young people who maintain a balanced diet and get enough sleep. "Healthy" describes the positive physical condition that results from these good habits.</p>

                        <p>The correct form is "formation" - a noun derived from the verb "form." The sentence requires a noun to describe the process by which stalactites and stalagmites were created or developed over time. "Formation" refers to the process of something being formed or the resulting structure.</p>

                        <p>The correct form is "naturally" - an adverb formed from the noun "nature." In this sentence, we need an adverb to describe how bones become weaker. "Naturally" indicates that this weakening is a normal part of the aging process and happens as a result of natural biological processes rather than external factors.</p>

                        <p>The correct form is "dangers" - the plural noun form of the adjective "dangerous." The sentence requires a noun to complete the phrase "be aware of the..." and since we're talking about multiple potential hazards of traveling in mountainous regions during rainy seasons (such as landslides, flash floods, difficult terrain), the plural form "dangers" is appropriate.</p>

                        <p>The correct form is "annoying" - an adjective formed from the verb "annoy." In this sentence, we need an adjective to describe the situation of people talking loudly on phones. "Annoying" describes something that causes irritation or mild anger, which fits the context perfectly.</p>

                        <p>The correct form is "leisurely" - an adverb formed from the noun "leisure." In this sentence, we need an adverb to describe how they explored beaches and cafés. "Leisurely" means in a relaxed, unhurried manner, which appropriately describes a vacation activity.</p>

"Though" and "Despite" both express contrast, but they have different grammatical structures. "Though" is used with a clause, while "Despite" is used with a noun or gerund.
